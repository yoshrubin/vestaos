# Vestaos
A Project to help spread the calculation for vestaos can help make sure they are correct and easily shared to create new apps


The basic calculations are days are `30`, `31`, `yom hachodesh`(may be difficult being we need the hebrew date) and `onah beinonis`(the amount of days between one period and another).

We will always end up with only 3 days total because `yom hachodesh` will either be `30` or `31` days apart.


##Challenges

1. How do we pick up on Onah Kavuah like if the user always has there period on either same `yom hachodesh` or same amount of days apart, there are other criteria too.
2.
